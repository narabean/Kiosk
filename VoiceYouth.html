        <p style="font-size:14pt;">The Beatles played a crucial role in igniting the emerging counterculture of the 1960s, as themes of social change and anti-establishment sentiment gained prominence during this transformative period. Recognized as icons of the global youth culture, their influence extended far beyond music. According to Strike Mag, The Beatles reignited a sense of hope and excitement among the youth that had been stripped away. The band encouraged the younger generation to take a deeper look at the world around them, inspiring a critical examination of societal norms and fostering a spirit of rebellion and cultural exploration.</p>
